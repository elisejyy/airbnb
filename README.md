AirBnB hosted a challenge for the Kaggle community to predict the country first-time AirBnB users
would choose as their first booking destination- a challenge the growing data science and analytics team
is constantly looking to tackle. With an increasing number of competitors and an aim to revolutionize
how consumers imagine leisure travel, the company’s goal was to improve its recommendation system
for customers and ensure their supply of home shares met travelers’ demand. Our team took this
chance to explore how machine learning and predictive analysis impacts our daily lives such as in
booking a vacation home.
